### DEMO PROJECT OF AN APPOINTMENT DASHBOARD WIP BASED ON THE DEVIAS KIT

Clone repo then run:

npm install

npm start

Uses Typescript, Redux, Material UI, Material Tables, React-Hook-Form

This repo should be paired with the idoc-backend strapi one.

Hopefully I the near future I ll get to host live versions on Azure cloud for demo purposes of both.
